Hi, I'm **Blanca Garcia Gil**. 

I am a very curious person. **I love learning**. I love traveling. I grew up in Spain and now live in the United Kingdom. I speak Spanish and English and I have been on and off trying to learn Mandarin. I find languages and food are a great way to learn about other cultures. 

I am an engineering leader and public speaker. I have created this blog as a more permanent home to write about ideas that are important to me, talks that I give and connect with people.

I did not start my programming journey with computers but my passion for Math led me to study Computer Science and Engineering.

Working in tech has given me the opportunity to work in different countries, different industries and appreciate and nurture diverse teams. 

Working with people from different backgrounds has broadened my horizons and helped me be more open and share my ideas instead of feeling like I had to blend in. I am passionate about helping not only women but people from underrepresented groups grow their careers in tech.

I worked at the BBC for the last 7 years, focused on building platform services in the cloud which involved high traffic APIs, reliable data ingestion pipelines, tackling performance issues in our data warehouse and data visualisation services. 

I am currently on a career break prioritising my mental health, enjoying time with my family and tacking a step back before thinking what's next.
